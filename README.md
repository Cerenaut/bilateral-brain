## [RFR: Left and Right Neural Networks – Inspired by our Bicameral Brains](https://wba-initiative.org/en/research/rfr/rfr-left-and-right-nn/)

### Summary

#### Overview

The brains of all bilaterally symmetric animals on Earth are Bicameral, that is, they are divided into left and right hemispheres. It is a remarkably conserved feature across species, indicating its importance for intelligence. The anatomy and functionality of the hemispheres have a large degree of overlap, but they specialise to possess different attributes. The most likely explanation for the emergent specialisation, is small differences in parameterisation of the substrate. For example, a higher rate of synaptic plasticity in one hemisphere, different relative layer sizes and different connectivity patterns within and across layers. The biological parameterisation could be equivalent to hyperparameters of an AI Machine Learning algorithm.

There could be great benefits to understanding and mimicking this pervasive design feature of biological intelligence by building bicameral ML algorithms – two parallel systems with different specialities. To our knowledge, this has never been explored. It has the potential to confer significant advantages and is an exciting prospect. The way to approach it is an open question, we can be inspired and guided by neuroscience models.

### Objective

The objective is to build a bicameral Machine Learning model with hemispheres resembling the biological counterparts. This will form the basis for further explorations of bicameralism, including interplay with other brain and neurotransmitter systems.
